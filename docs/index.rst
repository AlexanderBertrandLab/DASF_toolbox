DASF toolbox documentation
==========================

The DASF (Distributed Adaptive Signal Fusion) toolbox implements the DASF algorithm described in `[1] <https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2023.3275272>`_ and `[2] <https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2023.3275273>`_, allowing to solve optimization problems where the features are partitioned across multiple nodes within a network, for example, spatial filtering problems in wireless sensor networks. Note that this toolbox is intended for simulations, and does not provide an actual distributed protocol.
